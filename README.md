# ¿ About this page

This is a collection page for my LeetCode solutions.
I created this because GitHub’s landing page lacks a "pinning" option (for all my repos),
and I wanted a place to organize my code.
I mainly solve LeetCode problems for practice and to learn complex algorithms, rather than for job interviews.
